# Data Scrapping and Cleaning

We scrap data from

- [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/) for owners and userscores, 
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) for 70+ game features, using files taken from https://github.com/CraigKelly/steam-data.
- [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) for metacritic scores.
